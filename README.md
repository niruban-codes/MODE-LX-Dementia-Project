# 🧠 Dementia Diagnosis Prediction Using Non-Medical Features  
### *Machine Learning Model | Random Forest + Hyperparameter Tuning*

---

## 📌 Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to **predict dementia diagnosis** using **only non-medical features** from the NACC dataset.  
All medical, clinical, biomarker, and cognitive test fields were excluded according to hackathon rules.

The entire solution is implemented in **one Jupyter Notebook**, covering:

- Data cleaning  
- Preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- ID column removal  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Model training  
- Evaluation  
- Explainability
